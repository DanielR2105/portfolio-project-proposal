# Module 4 Portfolio Project Proposal

## Overview

We will soon introduce the requirements for your _Personal Portfolio Project_.

Much like in Module 2, you will have the freedom to choose the topic for your application.

This time, you'll create a **Full Stack Application** using the PERN stack.

This proposal will serve as a starting point for your ideas and plans.

\*\* **You must submit a proposal and receive approval from an instructor prior to working on your project.**

## Proposal Requirements:

The following requirements must be included in your proposal:

1. **Topic/Idea** -- can be a title w/ a short description

1. **3 User Stories** minimum, describing what a user can expect to see/do when using your application

1. **Wireframes** -- a lo-fidelity visual representation of your front-end using whatever tools you choose. (even pencil and paper)

1. **ERD** for your back-end. Only **one** table is required, but you must add all columns that are expected for each entry to your table(what info does an entry have?)
   _For example: a user may have id, name, email, phone_

Your proposal is to be submitted AFTER the Portfolio Project Requirements and Repo have been shared with you in class.

Please submit your proposal in a **group message with JD && Carlos** via Slack.

Topic: A book club app

User Stories:

MVP would be choosing a book and commenting on it similar to goodreads then after that is complete I would add on the additional features of being able to make book clubs for a chosen book
Work flow on the app would be starting off as basiclly a books discussion forum where discussion page for each book is essentially just a book club for that book --> creating book clubs with crud for the book, the users, goals and comments

1. Users can do full crud on any chosen book.
2. Users can click on any book to view the books details such as author and release date
3. Users can leave comments/reviews on any chosen book.

Stretch features:

1. Differentiate between regular users and the ones who created a club
2. Learn firebase to allow login and remember users
3. Implement search engine to choose a book and get its information from an api, potential apis I have researched include the google books api, goodreads api, and the new york times book api.
